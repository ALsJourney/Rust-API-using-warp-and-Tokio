# Rust-API-using-warp-and-Tokio

## Description

This is a simple example of how to use the Rust API framework warp and the Tokio runtime to create a simple API.

## Usage

To run the API, you need to have Rust installed. You can get it from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once you have Rust installed, you can run the API by running the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
cargo run
```

Then you should use the curl command with a query string to test the API. For example:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3030/?name=John
```
